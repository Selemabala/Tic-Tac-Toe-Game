# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is Tic Tac Toe, it is a classic two-player game, also known as "Noughts and Crosses" or "X's and O's". The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their respective symbols: one player (Human) uses 'H' and the other player (AI) uses 'A'.

The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

Basic Rules
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
One player is 'H', and the other player is 'A'. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
If all 9 squares are full and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is a draw.
